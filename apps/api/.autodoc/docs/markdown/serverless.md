This code is responsible for configuring and exporting the serverless configuration for the blog API project. The `Serverless` class is imported from the `serverless/aws` package and used to define the `serverlessConfiguration` object. This object contains various properties that define the behavior of the serverless application, such as the service name, framework version, plugins, custom settings, package settings, provider settings, and functions.

The `service` property is set to the name of the blog API service, which is retrieved from the `secrets` module. The `frameworkVersion` property is set to "3", indicating that the project is using version 3 of the Serverless Framework. The `plugins` property lists the plugins that are used in the project, including `serverless-plugin-scripts`, `serverless-esbuild`, `serverless-prune-plugin`, and `serverless-offline`.

The `custom` property contains custom settings for the project, including the `webpack`, `prune`, `scripts`, and `esbuild` settings. The `webpack` setting specifies that certain modules should be excluded from the webpack build, while the `prune` setting specifies that unused dependencies should be automatically removed. The `scripts` setting specifies hooks that should be run during the build process, and the `esbuild` setting specifies options for the esbuild bundler.

The `package` property specifies that dev dependencies should be excluded from the package and that each function should be packaged individually. The `provider` property specifies that the provider is AWS, the runtime is Node.js 18.x, the region is ap-northeast-2, and the stage is either the `STAGE` environment variable or "dev". The `apiGateway` property specifies various settings for the API Gateway, such as the minimum compression size, binary media types, and naming conventions.

The `environment` property specifies environment variables that are used by the functions, such as the Slack webhook URL, channel, and log levels. The `memorySize` property specifies the amount of memory allocated to each function, and the `timeout` property specifies the maximum execution time for each function. The `iam` property specifies the IAM role that is used by the functions, including the permissions to access S3 resources.

Finally, the `functions` property is imported from the `./src/handlers/functions` module and contains the definitions for each function in the project. The `serverlessConfiguration` object is exported so that it can be used by the Serverless Framework to deploy the blog API project to AWS.
