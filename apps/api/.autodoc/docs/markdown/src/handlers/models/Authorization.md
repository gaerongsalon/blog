This code defines an interface called Authorization that extends the APIGatewayAuthorizerResultContext interface from the aws-lambda library. The Authorization interface adds three properties: name, email, and application, all of which are of type string.

The purpose of this code is to provide a structure for defining authorization data that can be used in the larger project. In particular, this interface can be used to define the authorization context for an API Gateway authorizer function. An authorizer function is a Lambda function that is used to authenticate and authorize requests to an API Gateway API. When a request is made to the API, the authorizer function is called to determine whether the request is authorized or not. If the request is authorized, the authorizer function returns an authorization token that is included in the request headers. This token can then be used by downstream Lambda functions to determine whether the request is authorized or not.

By defining the Authorization interface, this code provides a standard way of defining the authorization context that can be used by all authorizer functions in the project. For example, a specific authorizer function might define an instance of the Authorization interface like this:

```
const authData: Authorization = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
  application: "my-app"
};
```

This authData object can then be returned by the authorizer function to indicate that the request is authorized. Downstream Lambda functions can then access the authData object to determine the user's name, email, and the application they are authorized to access.

Overall, this code plays an important role in defining the authorization context for the project and ensuring that all authorizer functions use a consistent data structure.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface called Authorization that extends the APIGatewayAuthorizerResultContext from the aws-lambda library and adds three properties: name, email, and application.

2. What is the significance of extending the APIGatewayAuthorizerResultContext?
- Extending the APIGatewayAuthorizerResultContext allows the Authorization interface to inherit properties and methods from the APIGatewayAuthorizerResultContext, which is used for authorizing API requests in AWS Lambda.

3. How is this code used in the overall project?
- It is unclear from this code alone how it is used in the overall project. It could potentially be used as a type for objects that represent authorized users or applications in the API.
