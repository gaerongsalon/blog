The code in this file defines a Lambda function that optimizes images uploaded to an S3 bucket. The function is triggered by an API Gateway event and returns a JSON response containing the optimized image keys.

The `handle` function is the entry point for the Lambda function and is of type `APIGatewayProxyHandler`. It takes in an event object and returns a response object. The function first extracts the `uploadKey` and `size` parameters from the event object. The `uploadKey` parameter is the S3 key for the uploaded image, while the `size` parameter specifies the desired size of the optimized image. The `size` parameter can be one of three values: "all", "sm", or "lg".

The function then initializes several S3 utility functions using the `getPrivateS3cb`, `getPrivateS3`, and `getPublicS3` functions. These utility functions are used to interact with the S3 bucket where the uploaded image is stored and the S3 bucket where the optimized images will be stored.

The `processImage` function is then called with the `uploadKey`, `size`, and S3 utility functions as arguments. This function resizes the uploaded image to the desired size(s) and stores the optimized images in the appropriate S3 bucket. The function returns an array of S3 keys for the optimized images.

Finally, the `handle` function returns a JSON response containing the array of optimized image keys with a status code of 200.

This Lambda function can be used as part of a larger image processing pipeline for a blog or other web application. It can be triggered by an API Gateway event whenever a new image is uploaded to the S3 bucket and can be used to generate optimized versions of the image for different device sizes. The optimized images can then be served to users to improve page load times and reduce bandwidth usage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a handler function for an API Gateway endpoint that optimizes images and returns their S3 keys.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several dependencies including `source-map-support/register`, `aws-lambda`, `@yingyeothon/slack-logger`, and `@blog/imaging/lib/processImage`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `handle` function?
- The `handle` function expects an event object as input and returns an object with a `statusCode` and `body` property as output. The `body` property is a JSON stringified array of S3 keys for the optimized images.
