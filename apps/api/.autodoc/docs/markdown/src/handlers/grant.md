This code is a part of an AWS Lambda function that serves as an API endpoint for a blog application. The purpose of this code is to handle requests to grant permissions to users. 

The code imports the necessary modules and functions, including the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` from the `aws-lambda` package, `checkPermission` function from the `./authorization/checkPermission` module, `getLogger` function from the `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` package, and `handleApi` function from the `./base` module. 

The `handle` function is the main function that handles the API request. It is an asynchronous function that takes in an `event` object and returns a response object with a `statusCode` of 200 and a `body` that contains the result of the `checkPermission` function. The `checkPermission` function is passed the `event` object as an argument and returns a JSON object that contains the user's permission status.

The `handleApi` function is a higher-order function that takes in an object with the `logger`, `handle`, and `options` properties as arguments and returns a function that can be used as an AWS Lambda function handler. The `logger` property is set to the `logger` object created using the `getLogger` function, which logs messages to a Slack channel. The `handle` property is set to the `handle` function defined earlier. The `options` property is an object that contains various options for the API endpoint, including the `authorization` option, which is set to `true` in this case, indicating that the API endpoint requires authorization.

Overall, this code defines a Lambda function that handles API requests to grant permissions to users. It uses the `handleApi` function to create a Lambda function handler that logs messages to a Slack channel and requires authorization. An example usage of this code would be to call the API endpoint with a POST request containing the user's credentials and the permission to be granted. The Lambda function would then verify the user's credentials and grant the permission if authorized.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `checkPermission` function imported from `./authorization/checkPermission`?
   - The `checkPermission` function is used to check the authorization of the `event` object passed to the `handle` function.
2. What is the `handleApi` function and where is it defined?
   - The `handleApi` function is defined in the `./base` module and is used to wrap the `handle` function with additional functionality such as error handling and response formatting.
3. What is the purpose of the `options` object passed to `handleApi`?
   - The `options` object is used to configure the behavior of the `handleApi` function, in this case enabling authorization checks by setting `authorization` to `true`.
