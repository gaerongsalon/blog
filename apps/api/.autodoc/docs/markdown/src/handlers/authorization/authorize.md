The code in this file is responsible for authorizing requests to the blog API. It imports the `APIGatewayProxyEvent` type from the `aws-lambda` library, as well as a `checkPermission` function from another file and a `getLogger` function from the `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` library. It then exports a default function called `authorize` that takes an `event` of type `APIGatewayProxyEvent` as its argument and returns nothing (`void`).

The `authorize` function first logs some debug information using the `getLogger` function, including the URL of the request, its headers, and the context of the authorizer. It then calls the `checkPermission` function with the `event` argument to determine whether the request has permission to write to the API. If the `writable` property of the `grant` object returned by `checkPermission` is `false`, the function throws an error indicating that the request is not authorized.

This code is likely used as middleware in the larger blog API project to ensure that only authorized requests are allowed to write to the API. It could be used in conjunction with other middleware functions to handle authentication, rate limiting, and other security-related tasks. Here is an example of how this function might be used in an Express.js app:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const authorize = require("./blog/api/authorize");

const app = express();

app.post("/posts", authorize, (req, res) => {
  // Only authorized requests will reach this point
  // Handle creating a new blog post here
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server listening on port 3000");
});
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `checkPermission` function being imported?
- The `checkPermission` function is being used to determine if the user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.

2. What logging library is being used and what is the purpose of the `logger` constant?
- The `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` library is being used for logging. The `logger` constant is used to create a logger instance with the name "authorize" and the current filename.

3. What happens if the user does not have writable permissions?
- If the user does not have writable permissions, an error is thrown with a message indicating that the user is not authorized and including information about the user's authorization context.
