This code defines an AWS Lambda function that generates a signed URL for uploading an image to a private S3 bucket. The function is triggered by an HTTP request and expects a query parameter called "type" that specifies the file type of the image to be uploaded. The function checks if the file type is allowed (PNG, JPG, JPEG, or GIF) and throws an error if it is not. If the file type is allowed, the function generates a unique file key using the nanoid library and concatenates it with the file type. It then calls a function from the "getPrivateS3" module to generate a signed URL for the S3 object with the specified key and content type. The function returns the signed URL and the file key in a JSON response with a 200 status code.

This function can be used as part of a larger project that requires secure image uploads to a private S3 bucket. The function can be integrated with an API Gateway endpoint to receive HTTP requests from a client application. The client application can include the "type" query parameter in the request to specify the file type of the image to be uploaded. The function generates a signed URL that the client application can use to upload the image directly to the S3 bucket without exposing the S3 credentials or requiring the Lambda function to handle the upload. The file key generated by the function can be used to reference the uploaded image in the S3 bucket. 

Example usage:
```
POST /upload-url?type=png HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "uploadKey": "abc123.png",
  "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/example-bucket/image-upload/abc123.png?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIA123456789&Expires=1234567890&Signature=abcdefg"
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for handling an API endpoint that generates a signed URL for uploading images to a private S3 bucket.

2. What dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `source-map-support`, `aws-lambda`, `@yingyeothon/slack-logger`, and `nanoid`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `handle` function?
- The `handle` function is an `APIGatewayProxyHandler` that expects an HTTP event as input and returns a JSON response with a `statusCode` of 200 and a `body` containing an `uploadKey` and a signed URL for uploading an image to S3. It also performs some error handling for invalid image types.
