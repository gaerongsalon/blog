The code in this file is responsible for handling authorization for the blog API. It exports a function called `handle` which is an implementation of the `APIGatewayAuthorizerHandler` interface from the `aws-lambda` package. This function takes an event object as input and returns a policy object that determines whether the request should be allowed or denied.

The `handle` function first extracts the authorization token from the event object. The token can be passed either as a header (`event.authorizationToken`) or as a query parameter (`event.queryStringParameters.authorization`). It then decodes the token using the `decodeJWT` function, which verifies the token's signature and returns an object containing the user's authorization information. If the token is invalid or has expired, `decodeJWT` returns `null`.

The `handle` function then constructs a policy object based on the result of the `decodeJWT` function. The policy object contains a `principalId` field set to "user", a `policyDocument` field that specifies whether the request should be allowed or denied, and a `context` field that contains the user's authorization information. The `policyDocument` field is constructed based on the `context` object: if the `context` object is not null, the policy allows the request (`Effect: "Allow"`); otherwise, it denies the request (`Effect: "Deny"`). The `Resource` field of the policy document is set to the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the API method being called, which is constructed by the `buildScopedMethodArn` function.

Finally, the `handle` function logs the policy and the token using the `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` package and returns the policy object.

The `decodeJWT` function takes the authorization token as input and returns an object containing the user's authorization information. It first removes the "Bearer " prefix from the token if it exists, then verifies the token's signature using the `jsonwebtoken` package and the `jwtSecretKey` from the `secrets` module. If the token is invalid or has expired, `decodeJWT` logs a warning message and returns `null`.

The `buildScopedMethodArn` function takes an object containing the ARN of the API method being called and returns a scoped ARN that includes the API ID, the AWS account ID, and the API stage. This scoped ARN is used as the `Resource` field of the policy document.

Overall, this code provides a secure way to authorize requests to the blog API by verifying JWT tokens and constructing policy documents based on the user's authorization information.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is an AWS Lambda function that handles authorization for an API Gateway. It decodes a JWT token and returns a policy document that either allows or denies access to the requested resource.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several external dependencies, including "source-map-support/register", "jsonwebtoken", "aws-lambda", "@yingyeothon/slack-logger", and "@blog/config/lib/secrets".

3. What is the format of the policy document that this code returns?
- The policy document returned by this code is an object with three properties: "principalId", "policyDocument", and "context". The "policyDocument" property is itself an object with two properties: "Version" and "Statement". The "Statement" property is an array of objects that specify the allowed or denied actions and resources.
