The code in this file is responsible for handling requests to retrieve images from the blog's content delivery network (CDN). It exports a single function called `handle` which is an implementation of the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` interface from the `aws-lambda` package. This function takes an HTTP request event as input and returns an HTTP response.

The `handle` function first extracts the image key from the request path parameters and the desired width from the query string parameters. If the desired width is not specified, it defaults to 1200 pixels. It then determines the preferred width based on whether the user agent is a mobile device or not. If it is a mobile device, the preferred width is set to the minimum of the desired width and 600 pixels.

Next, the function constructs the image path by calling a function from the `@blog/imaging` package that generates a file name for the image with the desired width. It then logs some debug information about the image request and returns a redirect response to the CDN URL for the image.

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to retrieve images from the blog's CDN with the desired width. It can be used by other parts of the blog's API or web application to display images in a responsive and optimized way. For example, a blog post page could use this function to retrieve the featured image for the post with the appropriate width based on the user's device.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `handleApi` and `throwError` functions imported from "./base"?
- `handleApi` is likely a function that handles the API request and response, while `throwError` is probably a utility function for throwing errors with specific status codes.

2. What is the role of the `@blog/imaging` and `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` packages?
- `@blog/imaging` is likely a package for image processing, while `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` is probably a package for logging to Slack.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `handle` function?
- The `handle` function is expected to be an `APIGatewayProxyHandler`, which means it should take in an `event` object and return a response object. In this case, it appears to be handling an image request and returning a redirect to a CDN URL.
