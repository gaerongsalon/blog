This code defines a Lambda function that handles requests to delete an article from a blog. The function is triggered by an API Gateway event and uses the `handleApi` function from the `base` module to handle the request. 

The function first extracts the article slug from the request path parameters and decodes it using the `encodedId` function from the `article` module. It then acquires a Redis lock using the `useRedisLock` function from the `redis` module to ensure that only one instance of the function is modifying the database at a time. 

Next, it uses the `useS3Sqlite` function from the `sqlite` module to create a connection to an SQLite database stored in an S3 bucket. It then executes the `deleteArticle` function from the `db` module to delete the article from the database. 

Finally, it returns a 200 status code with a JSON response indicating success. 

This Lambda function can be used as part of a larger serverless backend for a blog application. It provides a secure and scalable way to delete articles from the database, while ensuring that only one instance of the function is modifying the database at a time. 

Example usage:

```
POST /articles/{slug}/delete HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "ok": true
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `handleApi` function and where is it defined?
- The `handleApi` function is used to handle API Gateway events and is defined in the `./base` module.

2. What is the significance of the `dbLockRedisKey` constant and how is it used?
- `dbLockRedisKey` is a Redis key used to lock the articles database during the deletion process. It is passed as an argument to the `inLock` function from the `useRedisLock` module.

3. What is the expected format of the response body and status code for this API endpoint?
- The expected response body is a JSON object with a single property `ok` set to `true`. The expected status code is `200`.
