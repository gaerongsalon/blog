The `trimTags` function is designed to take in a string of tags and format them in a specific way. The purpose of this function is to ensure that the tags are properly formatted before they are used in other parts of the project. 

The function takes in a single parameter, `input`, which is expected to be a string of comma-separated tags. The function first checks if the `input` parameter is null or undefined using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`). If `input` is null or undefined, an empty string is used instead. 

Next, the function trims any leading or trailing whitespace from the `input` string using the `trim` method. The `split` method is then used to split the string into an array of individual tags, using the comma as the delimiter. Each tag in the resulting array is then trimmed using the `map` method, which applies the `trim` method to each element in the array. Finally, the `join` method is used to join the array back into a string, using the comma as the delimiter. 

The resulting string is then returned with a comma added to the beginning and end of the string. This is done to ensure that the tags are properly formatted for use in other parts of the project. 

Here is an example of how the `trimTags` function might be used in the larger project:

```javascript
const tags = "tag1, tag2, tag3";
const formattedTags = trimTags(tags);
console.log(formattedTags); // ",tag1,tag2,tag3,"
```

In this example, the `trimTags` function is used to format a string of tags. The original string is passed as a parameter to the function, and the resulting formatted string is stored in the `formattedTags` variable. The formatted string is then logged to the console, showing that the function has properly formatted the tags.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this function do?
   This function takes in a string input and returns a modified string with each tag trimmed and separated by commas.

2. What is the purpose of the ?? operator in this code?
   The ?? operator is a nullish coalescing operator that returns the value on the left if it is not null or undefined, otherwise it returns the value on the right. In this code, it ensures that an empty string is used if the input is null or undefined.

3. Are there any potential issues with using commas as separators for the tags?
   Depending on the context in which this function is used, commas may already be used for other purposes and could cause conflicts or parsing errors. It may be worth considering a different separator or a more robust tagging system.
