The `decodeId` function is a utility function that decodes a given string input. The purpose of this function is to check if the input string is encoded using the `%E[B-D]` pattern and if so, decode it using the `decodeURIComponent` function. If the input string is not encoded using this pattern, the function simply returns the input string as is.

This function can be used in the larger project to decode any encoded IDs that are passed in as parameters to API endpoints. For example, if a user wants to retrieve a blog post with an ID of `%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD`, the `decodeId` function can be used to decode the ID before querying the database for the corresponding blog post.

Here is an example usage of the `decodeId` function:

```
import decodeId from './decodeId';

const postId = '%E4%BD%A0%E5%A5%BD';
const decodedPostId = decodeId(postId);

// decodedPostId is now '你好'
```

Overall, the `decodeId` function is a simple yet useful utility function that can be used to decode encoded IDs in the larger blog/api project.
