The code in this file is responsible for returning a configured instance of the AWS S3 service that can be used to interact with a specific S3 bucket. The purpose of this code is to provide a simple way for other parts of the project to access the S3 service without having to worry about the details of configuring it.

The code imports two modules: `secrets` and `useS3`. The `secrets` module is used to retrieve the name of the S3 bucket that this code will be interacting with. The `useS3` module is a utility function that is responsible for configuring and returning an instance of the AWS S3 service.

The `getPublicS3` function is the main export of this file. It calls the `useS3` function with a configuration object that specifies the name of the S3 bucket to use. The function then returns the result of calling `useS3`, which is an instance of the AWS S3 service that is configured to interact with the specified bucket.

Other parts of the project can import this function and use it to interact with the S3 service. For example, if a component needs to upload a file to the S3 bucket, it can import `getPublicS3` and use it to get an instance of the S3 service:

```
import getPublicS3 from "@blog/api";

const s3 = getPublicS3();
s3.upload({
  Key: "example.txt",
  Body: "Hello, world!",
}, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(data);
  }
});
```

This code gets an instance of the S3 service by calling `getPublicS3`, and then uses that instance to upload a file to the bucket. The `Key` property specifies the name of the file to upload, and the `Body` property specifies the contents of the file. The callback function is called when the upload is complete, and logs any errors or the result of the upload.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code exports a function that returns an instance of an S3 bucket configured with the bucket name from the secrets file.

2. What is the "@blog" import syntax used in this code?
   The "@blog" syntax is likely a custom alias for a specific directory in the project, allowing for easier importing of modules within that directory.

3. What is the expected return type of the exported function?
   The expected return type of the exported function is the return type of the "useS3" function, which is not specified in this code snippet.
