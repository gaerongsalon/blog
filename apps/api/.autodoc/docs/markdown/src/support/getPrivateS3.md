The code in this file is responsible for returning a configured instance of the AWS S3 service that is used to interact with a private S3 bucket. The function `getPrivateS3` is exported as the default function from this file and returns an instance of the `useS3` function. 

The `useS3` function is imported from the `@blog/aws/lib/useS3` module and is responsible for creating and returning an instance of the AWS S3 service. This function takes an object with two properties as its argument: `bucketName` and `keyPrefix`. These properties are used to configure the S3 service instance that is returned. 

The `bucketName` property is set to the value of `secrets.s3.internalBucketName`, which is imported from the `@blog/config/lib/secrets` module. This value is the name of the private S3 bucket that the application is configured to use. 

The `keyPrefix` property is set to the value of `secrets.s3.internalKeyPrefix`, which is also imported from the `@blog/config/lib/secrets` module. This value is a prefix that is added to the keys of all objects that are stored in the private S3 bucket. 

By returning an instance of the `useS3` function with the appropriate configuration, the `getPrivateS3` function provides a simple way for other parts of the application to interact with the private S3 bucket. For example, if another module needs to upload a file to the private S3 bucket, it can import the `getPrivateS3` function and use it to create an instance of the S3 service. 

```javascript
import getPrivateS3 from "@blog/api";
const s3 = getPrivateS3();

// Upload a file to the private S3 bucket
s3.upload({
  Key: "example.txt",
  Body: "This is an example file",
}, (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log("File uploaded successfully");
  }
});
```

Overall, this code plays an important role in the larger project by providing a simple and consistent way for other parts of the application to interact with the private S3 bucket.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `secrets` import?
   - The `secrets` import is used to access sensitive information such as the internal S3 bucket name and key prefix.

2. What does the `useS3` function do?
   - The `useS3` function is likely a custom function that interacts with the AWS S3 service, possibly for uploading or retrieving files.

3. What is the expected return type of the `getPrivateS3` function?
   - The expected return type of the `getPrivateS3` function is the return type of the `useS3` function, which is likely an object or instance that can be used to interact with the private S3 bucket.
