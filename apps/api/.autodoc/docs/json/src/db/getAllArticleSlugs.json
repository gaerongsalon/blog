  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for retrieving all article slugs and titles from a SQLite database and returning them as an array of objects with the shape of ArticleSlugAndTitle. This function is exported as the default export of the file and can be used by other parts of the project that need to access article metadata.\n\nThe function takes an object with a single property, db, which is an instance of the SqliteDatabase class. This class is imported from a separate package called \"@blog/sqlite\" and is responsible for providing a simple interface for interacting with a SQLite database. \n\nThe SQL query used to retrieve the article slugs and titles is defined as a constant called GetAllArticleSlugsSQL. This query selects the slug and title columns from the article table and orders the results by the written column in descending order. \n\nThe getAllArticleSlugs function uses the prepare method of the SqliteDatabase instance to prepare the SQL query for execution. It then calls the all method on the prepared statement to retrieve all rows from the result set. The result is cast to an array of objects with the shape of ArticleSlugAndTitle using TypeScript's as keyword. If the result is null or undefined, an empty array is returned instead.\n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used in another part of the project:\n\n```typescript\nimport SqliteDatabase from \"@blog/sqlite/lib/SqliteDatabase\";\nimport getAllArticleSlugs, { ArticleSlugAndTitle } from \"./api\";\n\nconst db = new SqliteDatabase(\"path/to/database.sqlite\");\n\nconst articleSlugs: ArticleSlugAndTitle[] = getAllArticleSlugs({ db });\n\nconsole.log(articleSlugs);\n```\n\nIn this example, a new instance of the SqliteDatabase class is created with the path to the SQLite database file. The getAllArticleSlugs function is then called with the database instance as an argument, and the resulting array of article slugs and titles is logged to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ArticleMeta` and `SqliteDatabase` imports?\n- `ArticleMeta` is likely an entity class that contains metadata about articles, while `SqliteDatabase` is a library used to interact with SQLite databases.\n\n2. What does the SQL query in `GetAllArticleSlugsSQL` do?\n- The SQL query selects the `slug` and `title` columns from the `article` table, ordered by the `written` column in descending order.\n\n3. What does the `getAllArticleSlugs` function return?\n- The function returns an array of objects containing the `slug` and `title` properties of articles, obtained by executing the SQL query on the provided `db` object."
