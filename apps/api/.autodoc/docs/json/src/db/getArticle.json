  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for retrieving an article from a SQLite database based on its slug. It imports the Article class from a file located in the `entity` directory and the SqliteDatabase class from a separate package called `@blog/sqlite`. \n\nThe `GetArticleSQL` constant is a SQL query string that selects all columns from the `article` table where the `slug` column matches the provided `slug` parameter. The `COLLATE NOCASE` clause ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive.\n\nThe `getArticle` function takes an object with two properties as its parameter: `db` and `slug`. `db` is an instance of the `SqliteDatabase` class and `slug` is a string representing the slug of the article to be retrieved. The function returns an instance of the `Article` class that matches the provided `slug`.\n\nHere is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:\n\n```javascript\nimport SqliteDatabase from \"@blog/sqlite/lib/SqliteDatabase\";\nimport getArticle from \"./api/getArticle\";\nimport Article from \"./entity/Article\";\n\nconst db = new SqliteDatabase(\"blog.db\");\nconst slug = \"my-article-slug\";\nconst article: Article = getArticle({ db, slug });\n\nconsole.log(article.title); // logs the title of the retrieved article\n```\n\nIn this example, we first create a new instance of the `SqliteDatabase` class and pass it the name of the SQLite database file. We then define the `slug` of the article we want to retrieve and call the `getArticle` function, passing it the `db` instance and `slug`. The function returns an instance of the `Article` class that we can then use to access the properties of the retrieved article. In this case, we log the title of the article to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Article` entity and where is it defined?\n- The `Article` entity is imported from a file located at `./entity/Article`. It likely defines the structure and properties of an article object.\n\n2. What is the `SqliteDatabase` module and where is it imported from?\n- The `SqliteDatabase` module is imported from a package located at `@blog/sqlite/lib/SqliteDatabase`. It likely provides functionality for interacting with a SQLite database.\n\n3. What does the `getArticle` function do and what parameters does it expect?\n- The `getArticle` function takes in an object with two properties: `db` (an instance of `SqliteDatabase`) and `slug` (a string). It prepares and executes a SQL query to retrieve an article from the database with a matching `slug` value, and returns the result as an `Article` object."
