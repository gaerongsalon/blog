  "summary": "The `handle` function in this code file is an AWS Lambda function that searches for articles based on a given ID. The function takes in an event object and returns a response object. \n\nThe function first checks if the `id` parameter is present in the `pathParameters` object of the event. If it is not present, the function throws an `ApiError` with a status code of 404. \n\nIf the `id` parameter is present, the function fetches all article slugs from the `articleRepository` and decodes the given `id`. It then calculates the Levenshtein distance between the decoded `id` and each article slug, sorts them by distance, and selects the top `candidateCounts` articles with a distance less than or equal to `enduranceDistance`. \n\nThe function then returns a response object with a status code of 200, a JSON content type header, and a body containing the selected article candidates. If no candidates are found, the function throws an `ApiError` with a status code of 404. \n\nThis function can be used as an endpoint for a search feature in a larger blog API project. The function takes in a search query ID and returns a list of article candidates that match the query. The Levenshtein distance algorithm is used to find articles that are similar to the query, even if they are not an exact match. \n\nExample usage:\n```\n// Lambda function invocation\nconst event = {\n  pathParameters: {\n    id: \"example-id\"\n  }\n};\nconst response = await handle(event);\n\n// Response object\n{\n  statusCode: 200,\n  headers: {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n  },\n  body: JSON.stringify([\n    {\n      slug: \"example-slug-1\",\n      title: \"Example Title 1\",\n      distance: 5\n    },\n    {\n      slug: \"example-slug-2\",\n      title: \"Example Title 2\",\n      distance: 10\n    }\n  ])\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a handler function for an API endpoint that searches for articles based on a given ID.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including source-map-support, aws-lambda, @yingyeothon/slack-logger, and leven.\n\n3. What is the expected input and output of this code?\n- The expected input of this code is an HTTP request with a path parameter \"id\". The expected output is a JSON response containing an array of article candidates that match the given ID."
