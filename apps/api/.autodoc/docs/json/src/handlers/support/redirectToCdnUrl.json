  "summary": "This code exports a function called `redirectToCdnUrl` that takes a `relativePath` string as input and returns an `APIGatewayProxyResult` object. The purpose of this function is to redirect the user to a CDN (Content Delivery Network) URL for the specified `relativePath`. \n\nThe function first creates a new `URL` object using the `relativePath` and the CDN URL from the `metadata` module. It then logs a debug message with the `cdnUrl` and returns an `APIGatewayProxyResult` object with a status code of 301 (Moved Permanently), a `Location` header set to the `cdnUrl`, and a body containing the `cdnUrl`.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to improve performance by serving static assets (such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files) from a CDN instead of the origin server. By redirecting the user to the CDN URL, the user's browser can download the assets from a server closer to their location, reducing latency and improving page load times.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport redirectToCdnUrl from \"./api/redirectToCdnUrl\";\n\n// Redirect to CDN URL for image.png\nconst result = redirectToCdnUrl(\"/images/image.png\");\nconsole.log(result);\n// Output: { statusCode: 301, headers: { Location: \"https://cdn.example.com/images/image.png\" }, body: \"https://cdn.example.com/images/image.png\" }\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n- This code exports a function called `redirectToCdnUrl` that takes a `relativePath` string as input and returns an `APIGatewayProxyResult` object with a 301 status code and a `Location` header pointing to a CDN URL.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports the `APIGatewayProxyResult` type from the `aws-lambda` package, the `URL` class from the built-in `url` module, and the `getLogger` function from the `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` package. It also imports a `metadata` object from a module located at `@blog/config/lib/metadata`.\n\n3. What logging is included in this code?\n- This code uses the `getLogger` function to create a logger instance with the name `\"redirectToCdnUrl\"` and the filename of the current module. It then logs a debug message with an object containing the `cdnUrl` variable and the string `\"Go to CDN\"`."
