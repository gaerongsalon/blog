  "summary": "The `applySeo` function in this file is responsible for applying SEO (Search Engine Optimization) metadata to blog articles. When a request is made to the server for a specific article, this function is called with the URL of the request and the content of the article file. \n\nFirst, the function checks if the request is for an article and if the article ID is not one of the predefined IDs. If either of these conditions is not met, the function simply returns the original file content. If the conditions are met, the function proceeds to fetch the article data from the server's API using the article ID. \n\nIf the API call is successful, the function extracts the article metadata (title, slug, image, and excerpt) and uses it to generate the SEO metadata using the `injectMeta` function. This metadata includes information such as the article title, description, image, and URL, which are used by search engines to index and display the article in search results. \n\nIf the API call fails or the response is invalid, the function logs a warning or error message and returns the original file content. Finally, the function returns the updated file content with the SEO metadata injected into the `<head>` section of the HTML. \n\nThis function is an important part of the blog's SEO strategy, as it ensures that each article has the necessary metadata to be properly indexed and displayed in search results. It is called automatically for each article request, so there is no need for manual intervention. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nconst fileContent = \"<html><head><title>My Blog Article</title></head><body>...</body></html>\";\nconst requestUrl = \"/api/article/123\";\nconst updatedContent = await applySeo(requestUrl, fileContent);\nconsole.log(updatedContent); // \"<html><head>...SEO metadata...</head><body>...</body></html>\"\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is responsible for applying SEO metadata to articles in the blog API.\n\n2.
