  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for reading and returning information about a writer from an authorization event. It imports the `AuthorizerEvent` class from another file in the same directory, as well as the `Writer` model from a different directory. It also imports a `readAuthorization` function from another file in the same directory, and a `secrets` object from a configuration file.\n\nThe `readWriter` function takes an `AuthorizerEvent` object as its argument and returns a `Writer` object. It first calls the `readAuthorization` function with the `event` argument to extract the authorization information. If there is no authorization information, it throws an error. Otherwise, it searches for a writer in the `secrets.writers` array whose email matches the email in the authorization information. If it cannot find a matching writer, it throws an error. If it finds a matching writer, it returns that writer object.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to authenticate and authorize requests made to the API by writers. When a request is made, the `AuthorizerEvent` object is passed to this function to extract the authorization information and find the corresponding writer. This writer object can then be used to perform further actions on behalf of the authenticated writer, such as creating or updating blog posts.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport readWriter from \"./readWriter\";\nimport AuthorizerEvent from \"./AuthorizerEvent\";\n\n// create an AuthorizerEvent object with authorization information\nconst event = new AuthorizerEvent({\n  type: \"TOKEN\",\n  authorizationToken: \"Bearer myToken\",\n  methodArn: \"arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:123456789012:myApi/myStage/GET/myResource\",\n});\n\n// read the writer information from the event\nconst writer = readWriter(event);\n\n// use the writer object to perform actions on behalf of the authenticated writer\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AuthorizerEvent` import?\n   - The `AuthorizerEvent` import is used as a parameter for the `readWriter` function, indicating that it requires an event object with authorization information.\n\n2. What is the `secrets` import used for?\n   - The `secrets` import is used to access a list of writers' email addresses for authentication purposes.\n\n3. What happens if the `authorization` object is not found?\n   - If the `authorization` object is not found, the function will throw an error with the message \"No credential from event\"."
