  "summary": "This code defines a Lambda function that handles API requests for querying resources in a blog. The function is triggered by an API Gateway event and returns a JSON response with the queried data.\n\nThe function imports two modules: `source-map-support/register` and `./base`. The former is used for debugging purposes, while the latter contains utility functions for handling API requests and errors.\n\nThe function also imports the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` type from the `aws-lambda` module, which defines the shape of the Lambda function's input and output. Additionally, it imports a logger module called `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` for logging debug messages.\n\nThe function exports a `handle` function that conforms to the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` type. This function takes an event object as input, which contains information about the API request, such as the HTTP method, headers, and path parameters.\n\nThe `handle` function first extracts the `resource` and `id` path parameters from the event object. It then checks if the `resource` parameter is valid (i.e., one of \"article\", \"category\", or \"tag\") and if the `id` parameter is required for that resource. If the parameters are invalid, the function throws an `ApiError` with a 404 status code.\n\nIf the parameters are valid, the function calls a `queryResource` function with the `resource`, `id`, and query string parameters from the event object. This function queries a database for the requested resource and returns the result as an object.\n\nIf the query is successful, the function returns a JSON response with a 200 status code and the queried data in the response body. If the query fails, the function logs a debug message with the error and throws an `ApiError` with a 404 status code.\n\nThe function also sets an `accesslog` option to `true` in the `handleApi` function, which logs API requests to the console.\n\nThis code is used as a Lambda function in an AWS API Gateway to handle API requests for querying resources in a blog. It can be extended to handle other types of API requests, such as creating, updating, or deleting resources.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `queryResource` function being imported from `./query/queryResource`?\n- The `queryResource` function is used to query a specific resource (article, category, or tag) with optional query parameters and user agent information.\n\n2. What is the `handle` function and what does it do?\n- The `handle` function is an implementation of the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` interface that handles incoming API requests. It checks the path parameters to determine the requested resource and ID, calls the `queryResource` function to retrieve data, and returns a JSON response with the retrieved data.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `accesslog` option in the `handleApi` function?\n- The `accesslog` option enables logging of incoming API requests, including the request method, path, and response status code."
