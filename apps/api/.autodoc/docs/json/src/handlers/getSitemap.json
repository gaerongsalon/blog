  "summary": "This code is responsible for generating a sitemap for the blog/api project. A sitemap is an XML file that lists all the pages on a website to help search engines crawl and index them. \n\nThe code imports the necessary dependencies, including the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` from AWS Lambda, the `articleRepository` from the `article` module, and the `handleApi` function from the `base` module. It also imports the `getLogger` function from the `slack-logger` module and the `metadata` object from the `config` module.\n\nThe `handle` function is an AWS Lambda handler that returns the sitemap as an XML string. It first fetches all the article slugs from the `articleRepository` and then generates the sitemap XML using a template literal. The `map` function is used to iterate over each slug and generate a `<url>` element with the corresponding URL. The resulting XML string is then returned with a 200 status code and the appropriate headers.\n\nThis code can be used as a standalone Lambda function or integrated into a larger serverless architecture. It can be triggered by an event, such as a scheduled CloudWatch event, or by an API Gateway endpoint. The resulting sitemap can be used by search engines to discover and index all the articles on the blog/api website. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nimport { handle } from \"./blog/api/sitemap\";\n\n// Invoke the sitemap handler\nconst result = await handle();\n\n// Log the result\nconsole.log(result);\n```",
