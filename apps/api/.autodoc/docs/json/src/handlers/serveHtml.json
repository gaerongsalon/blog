  "summary": "The code in this file serves static resources for a web application. It is designed to be used with AWS Lambda and API Gateway. \n\nThe `handle` function is an implementation of the `APIGatewayProxyHandler` interface. It takes an HTTP request event and returns an HTTP response. The response contains the contents of a requested file, along with appropriate headers. \n\nThe `handle` function first resolves the path of the requested file. It does this by translating the request URL to a file path, and then checking if the file exists. If the file does not exist, it checks if the file has an HTML extension. If it does, it returns the path to the `index.html` file. This is to support client-side routing with frameworks like React Router. If the file still does not exist, it throws a 404 error. \n\nOnce the file path is resolved, the function reads the contents of the file and determines if it should be base64-encoded. If the file is a text file, it is not base64-encoded. If it is not a text file, it is base64-encoded. \n\nThe function then checks if the requested file is the `index.html` file. If it is, it applies SEO metadata to the file contents. This is done by calling the `applySeo` function from the `./seo/applySeo` module. \n\nFinally, the function constructs an HTTP response with the appropriate headers and returns it. The `Content-Type` header is set based on the file extension. The `Content-Length` header is set based on the size of the file. The `Cache-Control` header is set to allow caching of the file for a certain amount of time. \n\nThis code is used to serve static resources for a web application. It is designed to be used with AWS Lambda and API Gateway, but could be adapted for other serverless architectures. The `handle` function is the main entry point for the code, and should be invoked by the API Gateway when a request is received.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a handler function for serving static files in an AWS Lambda function.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n- This code has dependencies on \"source-map-support/register\", \"fs\", \"path\", \"aws-lambda\", \"mime-types\", and \"@yingyeothon/slack-logger\".\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"applySeo\" function?\n- The \"applySeo\" function is used to apply SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to HTML content by modifying the content to include metadata that can be used by search engines to improve the page's visibility in search results."
