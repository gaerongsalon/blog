  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for returning a configured instance of the AWS S3 service that is used to interact with a private S3 bucket. The function `getPrivateS3` is exported as the default function from this file and returns an instance of the `useS3` function. \n\nThe `useS3` function is imported from the `@blog/aws/lib/useS3` module and is responsible for creating and returning an instance of the AWS S3 service. This function takes an object with two properties as its argument: `bucketName` and `keyPrefix`. These properties are used to configure the S3 service instance that is returned. \n\nThe `bucketName` property is set to the value of `secrets.s3.internalBucketName`, which is imported from the `@blog/config/lib/secrets` module. This value is the name of the private S3 bucket that the application is configured to use. \n\nThe `keyPrefix` property is set to the value of `secrets.s3.internalKeyPrefix`, which is also imported from the `@blog/config/lib/secrets` module. This value is a prefix that is added to the keys of all objects that are stored in the private S3 bucket. \n\nBy returning an instance of the `useS3` function with the appropriate configuration, the `getPrivateS3` function provides a simple way for other parts of the application to interact with the private S3 bucket. For example, if another module needs to upload a file to the private S3 bucket, it can import the `getPrivateS3` function and use it to create an instance of the S3 service. \n\n```javascript\nimport getPrivateS3 from \"@blog/api\";\nconst s3 = getPrivateS3();\n\n// Upload a file to the private S3 bucket\ns3.upload({\n  Key: \"example.txt\",\n  Body: \"This is an example file\",\n}, (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"File uploaded successfully\");\n  }\n});\n```\n\nOverall, this code plays an important role in the larger project by providing a simple and consistent way for other parts of the application to interact with the private S3 bucket.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `secrets` import?\n   - The `secrets` import is used to access sensitive information such as the internal S3 bucket name and key prefix.\n\n2. What does the `useS3` function do?\n   - The `useS3` function is likely a custom function that interacts with the AWS S3 service, possibly for uploading or retrieving files.\n\n3. What is the expected return type of the `getPrivateS3` function?\n   - The expected return type of the `getPrivateS3` function is the return type of the `useS3` function, which is likely an object or instance that can be used to interact with the private S3 bucket."
