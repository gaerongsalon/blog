  "summary": "The `encodeId` function in the `blog/api` project is responsible for encoding a given string input into a URL-safe format. The function takes in a single parameter, `input`, which is a string that needs to be encoded. \n\nThe purpose of this function is to ensure that any non-ASCII characters in the input string are properly encoded before being used in a URL. This is important because URLs can only contain ASCII characters, and any non-ASCII characters must be encoded using a specific format. \n\nThe function first checks if the input string contains any Korean characters by using a regular expression that matches any character in the Korean alphabet. If the input string does contain Korean characters, the function uses the `encodeURIComponent` method to encode the string. This method replaces any non-ASCII characters with a percent-encoded representation of the character. \n\nIf the input string does not contain any Korean characters, the function simply returns the original input string without any encoding. \n\nHere is an example of how this function might be used in the larger `blog/api` project:\n\n```javascript\nimport encodeId from './encodeId';\n\nconst postId = '게시물1'; // Korean characters in the post ID\nconst encodedId = encodeId(postId); // Encodes the ID using encodeURIComponent\nconst postUrl = `https://example.com/posts/${encodedId}`; // Uses the encoded ID in a URL\n```\n\nIn this example, the `encodeId` function is used to encode a post ID that contains Korean characters. The resulting encoded ID is then used in a URL to create a link to the post. Without the encoding step, the URL would not be valid and could potentially cause errors or unexpected behavior.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this function?\n   - This function is used to encode a given string input into a URI-safe string, but only if the input contains Korean characters.\n2. What is the input parameter type for this function?\n   - The input parameter type for this function is a string.\n3. What is the output of this function?\n   - The output of this function is also a string, which is either the encoded version of the input string (if it contains Korean characters) or the original input string (if it does not contain Korean characters)."
