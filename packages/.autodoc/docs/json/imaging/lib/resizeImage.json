  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for resizing an image using the sharp library and logging the details of the operation using the slack-logger library. The function `resizeImage` takes in three parameters: `inputFile`, `outputFile`, and `resizedWidth`. `inputFile` is the path to the image file that needs to be resized, `outputFile` is the path where the resized image will be saved, and `resizedWidth` is the desired width of the resized image.\n\nThe function first logs the details of the operation using the `getLogger` function from the slack-logger library. It then uses the `sharp` library to resize the image. The `sharp` library is a high-performance image processing library that provides a simple and efficient API for resizing, cropping, and manipulating images. The `resize` method of the `sharp` library is used to resize the image to the desired width. The `toFile` method is then used to save the resized image to the specified output file.\n\nThe function returns the path of the output file as a string. This function can be used in the larger project to resize images before they are uploaded to the blog. For example, if the blog requires all images to be a certain width, this function can be used to ensure that all images meet that requirement. Here is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```\nimport resizeImage from \"./packages/resizeImage\";\n\nconst inputFile = \"path/to/image.jpg\";\nconst outputFile = \"path/to/resized-image.jpg\";\nconst resizedWidth = 800;\n\nconst resizedImagePath = await resizeImage({ inputFile, outputFile, resizedWidth });\nconsole.log(`Resized image saved to ${resizedImagePath}`);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `resizeImage` function is imported and called with the appropriate parameters. The function returns the path of the resized image, which is then logged to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code exports a function that resizes an image using the sharp library and returns the path to the resized image file.\n\n2. What are the required input parameters for the `resizeImage` function?\n   The `resizeImage` function requires three input parameters: `inputFile` (string), `outputFile` (string), and `resizedWidth` (number).\n\n3. What external libraries are being used in this code?\n   This code is using two external libraries: `@yingyeothon/slack-logger` for logging and `sharp` for image processing."
