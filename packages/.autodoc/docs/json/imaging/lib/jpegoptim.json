  "summary": "The `jpegoptim` function in this file is responsible for optimizing JPEG image files using the `jpegoptim` command-line tool. The function takes an object as an argument with two properties: `jpgFiles` and `timeout`. `jpgFiles` is an array of file paths to the JPEG images that need to be optimized. `timeout` is an optional parameter that specifies the maximum amount of time the optimization process can take before timing out. \n\nThe function first calls the `prepareExternals` function to get the path to the `jpegoptim` command-line tool. It then logs a trace message with the path and the list of files that will be optimized. \n\nNext, the function spawns a new process using the `execa` library, passing the path to `jpegoptim` and an array of command-line arguments. The arguments include options to force optimization (`-f`), overwrite the original files (`-o`), print verbose output (`-v`), preserve file timestamps (`-s`), and set the quality level to 95 (`-m95`). The `...jpgFiles` syntax is used to spread the `jpgFiles` array into the argument list. \n\nThe function returns a promise that resolves when the optimization process completes. If the process takes longer than the specified `timeout`, it is killed and the promise is rejected with an error message. Otherwise, the promise is resolved with no value. \n\nThe function also logs a trace message when the optimization process completes, including information about the process's exit code, whether it failed or was killed, and any output to `stdout` or `stderr`. If the process completed successfully, the function resolves the promise. If it failed, the function still resolves the promise but logs a message indicating that there was an error. \n\nThis function can be used in a larger project to optimize JPEG images as part of a build process or other automated workflow. For example, a static site generator might use this function to optimize images before generating HTML pages. Here's an example of how the function might be used:\n\n```\nimport jpegoptim from \"./packages/jpegoptim\";\n\nconst imagePaths = [\"path/to/image1.jpg\", \"path/to/image2.jpg\", \"path/to/image3.jpg\"];\n\njpegoptim({ jpgFiles: imagePaths, timeout: 5000 })\n  .then(() => {\n    console.log(\"JPEG optimization complete!\");\n  })\n  .catch((err) => {\n    console.error(\"Error optimizing JPEG images:\", err);\n  });\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n   - This code exports a function called `jpegoptim` that takes in an object with `jpgFiles` and `timeout` properties as arguments. It uses `execa` to run the `jpegoptim` command with some options and the provided `jpgFiles`, and returns a promise that resolves when the command completes or rejects if it times out.\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code imports `execa` and `getLogger` from external packages `execa` and `@yingyeothon/slack-logger`, respectively. It also imports a function called `prepareExternals` from a local file.\n3. What is the purpose of the `prepareExternals` function?\n   - The `prepareExternals` function is not shown in this code, but it is imported and called within the `jpegoptim` function. Based on its name, it is likely responsible for preparing any external dependencies needed by the `jpegoptim` command before it is executed."
