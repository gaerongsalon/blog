  "summary": "The code in this file exports a function called `getImageFileNameWithDesiredWidth` that takes in an object with two properties: `inputFile` and `desiredWidth`. The purpose of this function is to generate a new image file name with the desired width appended to the original image file name.\n\nTo achieve this, the function first imports the `path` module, which is used to extract the file extension and base name from the `inputFile` path. The file extension is then converted to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method to ensure consistency.\n\nNext, the base name of the `inputFile` is extracted using the `path.basename()` method, which takes in the `inputFile` path and the file extension obtained earlier. This ensures that the base name does not include the file extension.\n\nFinally, the function returns a string that concatenates the base name, the desired width, and the file extension. This new file name can be used to generate a new image with the desired width.\n\nHere is an example usage of this function:\n\n```javascript\nimport getImageFileNameWithDesiredWidth from \"./packages\";\n\nconst inputFile = \"/path/to/image.jpg\";\nconst desiredWidth = 500;\n\nconst newFileName = getImageFileNameWithDesiredWidth({\n  inputFile,\n  desiredWidth,\n});\n\nconsole.log(newFileName); // \"image_500.jpg\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the function takes in an `inputFile` path of \"/path/to/image.jpg\" and a `desiredWidth` of 500. The function then generates a new file name of \"image_500.jpg\" and returns it. This new file name can be used to generate a new image with a width of 500 pixels.",
  "questions": "1. What does this function do?\n- This function takes in an object with an `inputFile` string and a `desiredWidth` number, and returns a string with the image file name appended with the desired width.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `path` module import?\n- The `path` module is used to extract the file extension and base name from the `inputFile` string.\n\n3. Are there any potential issues with using this function?\n- One potential issue is that the function assumes that the `inputFile` string contains a valid file extension. If the string does not contain a valid extension, the function may not work as intended."
