This code exports a type alias called `RunResult` that is equivalent to the `RunResult` type defined in the `better-sqlite3` package. 

Type aliases are used in TypeScript to create a new name for an existing type. In this case, the `RunResult` type alias is created to make the code more readable and easier to maintain. By using the `RunResult` alias, developers can refer to the `better-sqlite3` `RunResult` type without having to import it directly from the package.

This code is likely used in other parts of the `blog` project that require interaction with a SQLite database using the `better-sqlite3` package. For example, if there is a module that performs database queries and returns a `RunResult`, it can use the `RunResult` type alias to ensure that the returned value is of the correct type.

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a module that performs a database query:

```
import db from './db';
import type { RunResult } from './packages';

function updatePostTitle(id: number, newTitle: string): RunResult {
  const stmt = db.prepare('UPDATE posts SET title = ? WHERE id = ?');
  return stmt.run(newTitle, id);
}
```

In this example, the `updatePostTitle` function takes an `id` and a `newTitle` parameter and updates the title of a post in the database. The function returns a `RunResult` object, which is defined using the `RunResult` type alias exported from the `packages` module. By using the `RunResult` type alias, the function can ensure that the returned value is of the correct type, without having to import the `better-sqlite3` package directly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `better-sqlite3` package?
   - The `better-sqlite3` package is likely a dependency for this code and is used for SQLite database operations.

2. What is the `RunResult` type and where is it defined?
   - The `RunResult` type is an alias for the `BetterSqlite3RunResult` type, which is imported from the `better-sqlite3` package.

3. Why is the `RunResult` type being exported as the default export?
   - It's possible that the `RunResult` type is a commonly used type throughout the project and is being exported as the default to make it easier to import and use in other files.
