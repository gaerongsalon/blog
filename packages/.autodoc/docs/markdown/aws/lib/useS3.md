The code is a module that exports a function called `useS3`. This function returns an object that contains several methods that interact with Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). The `useS3` function takes an object as an argument that contains two properties: `bucketName` and `keyPrefix`. The `bucketName` property is a string that represents the name of the S3 bucket that the methods will interact with. The `keyPrefix` property is an optional string that is used to prefix all S3 object keys that are passed to the methods. 

The returned object contains the following methods:

- `downloadToLocal`: This method takes an object that contains two properties: `s3ObjectKey` and `localFile`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that will be downloaded. The `localFile` property is a string that represents the path of the local file that the S3 object will be downloaded to. The method returns a promise that resolves to the path of the downloaded file.

- `uploadLocalFile`: This method takes an object that contains three properties: `s3ObjectKey`, `localFile`, and `contentType`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that will be uploaded. The `localFile` property is a string that represents the path of the local file that will be uploaded. The `contentType` property is an optional string that represents the content type of the S3 object. If it is not provided, the method will attempt to determine the content type from the file extension. The method returns a promise that resolves when the upload is complete.

- `deleteKey`: This method takes an object that contains one property: `s3ObjectKey`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that will be deleted. The method returns a promise that resolves when the deletion is complete.

- `putJSON`: This method takes an object that contains two properties: `s3ObjectKey` and `value`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that will be created or updated. The `value` property is an object that will be serialized to JSON and stored in the S3 object. If the `value` property is null, an empty string will be stored in the S3 object. The method returns a promise that resolves when the S3 object is created or updated.

- `getJSON`: This method takes an object that contains one property: `s3ObjectKey`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that will be retrieved. The method returns a promise that resolves to the deserialized JSON object that is stored in the S3 object. If the S3 object does not exist, the promise resolves to null.

- `exists`: This method takes an object that contains one property: `s3ObjectKey`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that will be checked for existence. The method returns a promise that resolves to true if the S3 object exists and false if it does not.

- `getSignedUrl`: This method takes an object that contains four properties: `s3ObjectKey`, `contentType`, `expires`, and `acl`. The `s3ObjectKey` property is a string that represents the key of the S3 object that the signed URL will be generated for. The `contentType` property is a string that represents the content type of the S3 object. The `expires` property is an optional number that represents the number of seconds that the signed URL will be valid for. The default value is 600 (10 minutes). The `acl` property is an optional string that represents the access control list of the S3 object. The default value is "public-read". The method returns a promise that resolves to a signed URL that can be used to access the S3 object.

The `useS3` function is used to create an object that can be used to interact with an S3 bucket. The `downloadToLocal` method can be used to download an S3 object to a local file. The `uploadLocalFile` method can be used to upload a local file to an S3 object. The `deleteKey` method can be used to delete an S3 object. The `putJSON` and `getJSON` methods can be used to store and retrieve JSON objects in S3 objects. The `exists` method can be used to check if an S3 object exists. The `getSignedUrl` method can be used to generate a signed URL that can be used to access an S3 object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports a function called `useS3` that returns an object with various methods for interacting with an AWS S3 bucket, including uploading and downloading files, deleting keys, and getting signed URLs.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several modules from external packages, including `@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `fs`, `path`, `mime-types`, `@yingyeothon/slack-logger`, and `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`.

3. What is the purpose of the `S3Extended` interface?
- The `S3Extended` interface extends the `S3` interface returned by the `S3` module in this package, adding a `getSignedUrl` method that returns a signed URL for a given S3 object key.
