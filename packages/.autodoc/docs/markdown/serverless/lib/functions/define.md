The code in this file is responsible for defining a function handler for an AWS Lambda function. It imports the `AwsFunctionHandler` interface from the `serverless/aws` module, as well as a `HandlerSpec` interface and a `defineFunction` function from other files in the project. 

The `define` function takes a `HandlerSpec` object as its argument and returns an object with a single key-value pair. The key is the `fileName` property of the `HandlerSpec` object, and the value is the result of calling the `defineFunction` function with the `HandlerSpec` object as its argument. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a simple way to define AWS Lambda function handlers in the larger project. By calling the `define` function with a `HandlerSpec` object, developers can quickly create a function handler that can be used in their serverless application. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in the larger project:

```
import defineHandler from "./packages/defineHandler";

const handlerSpec = {
  fileName: "myHandler",
  handler: async (event: any, context: any) => {
    // handle the event
  }
};

const myHandler = defineHandler(handlerSpec);

export { myHandler };
```

In this example, the `defineHandler` function is imported from the `./packages/defineHandler` file. A `handlerSpec` object is defined with a `fileName` property and a `handler` function that will be called when the Lambda function is triggered. The `defineHandler` function is called with the `handlerSpec` object as its argument, and the resulting `myHandler` object is exported for use in the serverless application. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to define AWS Lambda function handlers in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `HandlerSpec` import?
   - The `HandlerSpec` import is used to define the specification for the AWS Lambda function handler.
2. What is the `defineFunction` function used for?
   - The `defineFunction` function is used to define the AWS Lambda function based on the `HandlerSpec` specification.
3. What is the expected output of the `define` function?
   - The `define` function is expected to return an object with a key-value pair where the key is the `spec.fileName` and the value is the AWS Lambda function handler defined by the `defineFunction` function.
