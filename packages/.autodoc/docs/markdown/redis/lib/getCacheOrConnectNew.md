The code above is a module that exports a function called `getCacheOrConnectNew`. This function is used to get a Redis connection from a cache or create a new one if it doesn't exist. The Redis connection is established using the `redisConnect` function from the `@yingyeothon/naive-redis/lib/connection` package.

The function takes a single argument, `config`, which is an object containing the Redis configuration options. These options include the Redis server host, port, and password.

The function first checks if there is a cached Redis connection that is still valid. If there is, it returns the cached connection. If not, it creates a new Redis connection using the `redisConnect` function and caches it for future use. The cached connection is set to expire after 3 minutes (180000 milliseconds) to ensure that a new connection is created periodically.

If there is an existing cached connection that has expired, the function disconnects the socket associated with the connection before creating a new one.

This module can be used in a larger project that requires Redis connections. By using this module, the project can avoid creating new connections every time it needs to interact with Redis, which can be expensive in terms of time and resources. Instead, it can reuse existing connections from the cache, which can improve performance and reduce resource usage.

Example usage:

```javascript
import getCacheOrConnectNew from "blog/packages";

const redisConfig = {
  host: "localhost",
  port: 6379,
  password: "mypassword",
};

const redisConnection = getCacheOrConnectNew(redisConfig);

// Use the Redis connection to interact with Redis
redisConnection.set("mykey", "myvalue");
const value = await redisConnection.get("mykey");
console.log(value); // Output: "myvalue"
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `redisConnect` import and what does it do?
   - The `redisConnect` import is used to establish a connection to a Redis server.
2. What is the purpose of the `getCacheOrConnectNew` function and how is it used?
   - The `getCacheOrConnectNew` function is used to retrieve a Redis connection from a cache or establish a new connection if one does not exist. It takes a `RedisConfig` object as an argument and returns a `RedisConnection` object.
3. What is the purpose of the `expirationMillis` and `connectionCache` variables?
   - The `expirationMillis` variable sets the amount of time in milliseconds that a Redis connection can be cached before it is considered expired. The `connectionCache` variable is an object that stores a Redis connection and the time at which it will expire.
