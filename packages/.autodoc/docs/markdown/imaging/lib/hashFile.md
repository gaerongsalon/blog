The code in this file is a function that takes a file path as input and returns a Promise that resolves to the SHA-1 hash of the file. The function uses the Node.js built-in modules `crypto` and `fs` to read the file and compute its hash.

To use this function in the larger project, a developer can import it and call it with the path of the file they want to hash. For example:

```javascript
import hashFile from "./packages/hashFile";

const filePath = "/path/to/file.txt";
hashFile(filePath)
  .then((hash) => console.log(`The hash of ${filePath} is ${hash}`))
  .catch((error) => console.error(`Error hashing ${filePath}: ${error}`));
```

This code imports the `hashFile` function from the `packages` directory and calls it with the path of a file. The function returns a Promise that resolves to the hash of the file, which is then logged to the console. If an error occurs during the hashing process, the Promise is rejected and an error message is logged to the console.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to compute the hash of a file in the larger project. The SHA-1 hash can be used for various purposes, such as verifying the integrity of the file or detecting changes to its contents.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   This code exports a function called `hashFile` that takes a file path as input and returns a Promise that resolves to a string representing the SHA1 hash of the file.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   This code depends on the `crypto` and `fs` modules, which are built-in Node.js modules.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `hashFile` function?
   The `hashFile` function expects a string representing a file path as input and returns a Promise that resolves to a string representing the SHA1 hash of the file.
