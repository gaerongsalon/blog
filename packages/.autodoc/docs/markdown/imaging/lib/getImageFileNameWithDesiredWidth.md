The code in this file exports a function called `getImageFileNameWithDesiredWidth` that takes in an object with two properties: `inputFile` and `desiredWidth`. The purpose of this function is to generate a new image file name with the desired width appended to the original image file name.

To achieve this, the function first imports the `path` module, which is used to extract the file extension and base name from the `inputFile` path. The file extension is then converted to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method to ensure consistency.

Next, the base name of the `inputFile` is extracted using the `path.basename()` method, which takes in the `inputFile` path and the file extension obtained earlier. This ensures that the base name does not include the file extension.

Finally, the function returns a string that concatenates the base name, the desired width, and the file extension. This new file name can be used to generate a new image with the desired width.

Here is an example usage of this function:

```javascript
import getImageFileNameWithDesiredWidth from "./packages";

const inputFile = "/path/to/image.jpg";
const desiredWidth = 500;

const newFileName = getImageFileNameWithDesiredWidth({
  inputFile,
  desiredWidth,
});

console.log(newFileName); // "image_500.jpg"
```

In this example, the function takes in an `inputFile` path of "/path/to/image.jpg" and a `desiredWidth` of 500. The function then generates a new file name of "image_500.jpg" and returns it. This new file name can be used to generate a new image with a width of 500 pixels.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this function do?
- This function takes in an object with an `inputFile` string and a `desiredWidth` number, and returns a string with the image file name appended with the desired width.

2. What is the purpose of the `path` module import?
- The `path` module is used to extract the file extension and base name from the `inputFile` string.

3. Are there any potential issues with using this function?
- One potential issue is that the function assumes that the `inputFile` string contains a valid file extension. If the string does not contain a valid extension, the function may not work as intended.
