The code in this file exports a function called `sleep` that takes in a parameter `millis` of type `number`. The purpose of this function is to pause the execution of the program for a specified amount of time, given in milliseconds. 

The function returns a `Promise` that resolves after the specified amount of time has passed. The `Promise` resolves with `void`, indicating that it does not return any value. 

This function can be useful in scenarios where we need to delay the execution of a certain task. For example, in a blog application, we may want to delay the loading of a page or a component until a certain amount of time has passed. We can use the `sleep` function to achieve this by calling it before rendering the component or page. 

Here is an example of how we can use the `sleep` function in a blog application:

```
import sleep from './packages';

function loadPage() {
  // Delay the loading of the page by 2 seconds
  sleep(2000).then(() => {
    // Render the page after 2 seconds
    renderPage();
  });
}
```

In the above example, we import the `sleep` function from the `packages` module and use it to delay the loading of the page by 2 seconds. Once the `Promise` returned by the `sleep` function resolves, we render the page using the `renderPage` function. 

Overall, the `sleep` function provides a simple and efficient way to pause the execution of a program for a specified amount of time, making it a useful utility function in various scenarios.
## Questions: 
 1. What does the `sleep` function do?
   - The `sleep` function takes in a number of milliseconds as an argument and returns a Promise that resolves after the specified time has elapsed.
2. What is the expected input type for the `millis` argument?
   - The `millis` argument is expected to be a number representing the number of milliseconds to wait before resolving the Promise.
3. Is there any error handling included in this function?
   - No, there is no error handling included in this function. If an error occurs during the `setTimeout` operation, it will not be caught or handled by this function.
